[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_sheep):
`Electric Sheep is a distributed computing project for animating and evolving fractal flames, which are in turn distributed to the networked computers`

Originaly designed by http://www.electricsheep.org/ but rendered at low resolutions i am trying to bring the sheeps to the next generation of computer displays.
This is the early alpha of a client for an electric sheep ecosystem which renders frames in HD ( e.g. 720p, 1080p, 4k, 8k).
For a good example of what electric sheeps are see [this youtube vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo8IC8sMXwQ)

## Roadmap
- System is fully operational but in an alpha state. So expect [bugs](https://github.com/kochd/electricsheep-hd-client/issues).
- Currently there is no frontend where you can you can see the overall rendering process by the community.
- GPU rendering with CUDA is planned but this need more investigation

## Getting started
### Debian / Ubuntu / ...
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/kochd/electricsheep-hd-client.git && cd electricsheep-hd-client
apt-get install flam3 ruby
sudo gem install 
bundle install bundler
./daemon
</pre>

If this results in `./daemon.rb:29:in <main>': You will need an api key. Please register at https://sheeps.triple6.org:9999/register (RuntimeError)` continue with [registration](https://github.com/kochd/electricsheep-hd-client#registration).

### Other Linux / Unix / Posix systems
Currently i dont know. Adept from [Debian / Ubuntu](https://github.com/kochd/electricsheep-hd-client/blob/master/README.md#debian--ubuntu--) and contribute back so others can learn from your wisdom.

### Windows
* Download [this master](https://github.com/kochd/electricsheep-hd-client/archive/master.zip)
* Add [the blob](https://sheeps.triple6.org/git_flam3_ruby.zip) to the master
* Run daemon_windows.cmd

## Registration
Register [here](https://sheeps.triple6.org/register) and follow the instructions in the email.
The certificated is self-signed. You should be fine ignoring the warning and process to the page.

## Usage
<pre>
Usage: daemon [OPTIONS]
        --server SERVER              Control server to connect to
        --apikey APIKEY              Your api key
        --debug                      Debug-mode
        --no-download                Do not download movies
        --nice NICENESS              Niceness (Higher values result in lower process priority (default: 19, max: 19))
</pre>

Once your daemon is rendering frames you will gain so called credits for every frame you have rendered. Your daemon will then start to "buy" completed sequences using your gained credits and download them to `$BASE_DIR/branches/$CURRENT_BRANCH/movies`. Currently you will only get short sequences of 5 seconds which you need to concat your self if you want a full blown movie.
